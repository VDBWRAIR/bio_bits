sequence_concat.py

+++++++++++++++++ Intro ++++++++++++++++
When you have many fasta files that need to be concatenated into one file it can be a daunting task.
sequence_conat.py will take in all the fasta files in a directory and output a single concatenated file
using all of those files.

++++++++++++++++++ Usage +++++++++++++++++
./sequence_concat.py -h
Shows you the help message

Options Supported:
-d or --fasta_dir tells the script which directory to search in for fasta files. The files must end in fna or fas
--strip <chars> tells the script to strip out characters that you supply. By default the script removes all '-' characters(dashes)
--debug <level> tells the script to output debugging information from a scale of 0 = Normal to 3 = Debug(lots of output)

++++++++++++++++ Examples ++++++++++++++++
This will run the sequence_concat.py on the test directory and output the concatenated sequences to the screen
./sequence_concat.py -d test

This will run the sequence_concat.py on the test directory and also strip all of the 'R' out of the sequences
./sequence_concat.py -d test --strip R
